# Connect Four Against an AI in Python
This was my final project from my first year (second semester) computer science course at the Univeristy of Toronto. I created a game of connect four where a user plays against an AI of different skill levels. The AI uses the concept of game trees along with the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning to make its decisions.
